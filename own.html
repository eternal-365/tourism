              The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural
              achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its
              recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of
              solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as
              arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a
              piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud
              passions of an emperorâ€™s love wrought in living stones.

                The family ruled the area from 1399, when they first lived in a palace at Mysore, and the city became the kingdom's capital in 1799. 
                While it is believed that the palace originally was built no later than 1574,
                the first recorded mention of a palace on the current site was in 1638.
                The best time to visit the palace is around the time of Dussehra when the entire compound is beautifully decorated and lit, illuminated in a golden hue. 
                The palace is lit every Sunday and on all public holidays.

                Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.[21] Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. 
                The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby Sarnath has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century BCE.[22][23] In the 8th century, 
                Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, 
                a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas.[24] In the 16th century, 
                Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in the city; they also built other temples, 
                all displaying an empire-wide architectural style.
